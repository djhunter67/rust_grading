# 100 DAYS of CODE
### Author: Christerpher Hunter

- I am mildly experienced using Python and I have a fair understanding of software development concepts.
- I am brand spanking new to the Rust programming language.  

## Day 2: Grading

- This is an extremely simple program written in Rust that takes in a number grade and prints a letter grade.
- The Day two version will go from plain letter grades to using `+` and `-` criteria for grades.
- I will also explore `structs` and `impl` of the methods related to `structs`.
